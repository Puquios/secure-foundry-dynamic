## Overview 
IBM DevOps Services has a Continuous Delivery Pipeline for deploying Cloud Foundry applications, containers, and micro-services to IBM Bluemix. You can use a textual representation of a pipeline defined by a pipeline.yml file, which makes it easy to share and copy interesting pipelines. The Deploy to Bluemix button provides a simple way to clone a project that includes the source files and the Delivery Pipeline configuration. 

## The application 
Very simple java application based upon the Bluemix sample WordCounter sample app https://hub.jazz.net/project/pskhadke/WordCounter/overview that runs within a Liberty application server.  

The application can be deployed as either a Cloud Foundry application or a Container on Bluemix.  

ShowResult.java has been modified so that it has a two common security issues.  This allows the application to be used to demonstrate dynamic code scan capabilities.  

To say hello: http://myroute.mydomain?name=myName
To say inject a security issue: http://myroute.mydomain?name=<img src=x onerror=alert("ha") />

## The pipeline 
An interesting pipeline that demonstrates a few more advanced delivery pipeline capabilties 

- Package Application
    + Basic ant build to package a war file 
- Deploy Stage
    + Deploys the war as a Cloud Foundry application to Bluemix 
- Security Scanning
    + Leverages IBM Application Security on Cloud to run a security scan against the running application.  Provides a link to a dashboard of security reports.

The stages are setup with slack notifications.  By simply providing a slack WebHook in the stage configuration files you can recieve notifications of just job failures, or all activity in the pipeline.
